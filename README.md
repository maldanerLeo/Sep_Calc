EN:
Academic software entirely develop in Python for mass balance calculations in a binary mixture separator.

This was my firts big project in Python and it was develop in 2019 during my final semester in chemical engineering.

We used modularization to implement an optimization algorithm that can solve all the cases of the separator, this is the main difference of our software. 

The numerical optimization method we choose was the Broyden method, derived from Newton’s method. 

The graphical part was developed using the Kivy library from MIT.
